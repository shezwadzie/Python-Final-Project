COVID-19 GLOBAL TRACKER
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It explores confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts across countries over time. The notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insightful visualizations to present key trends and comparisons. The final output is a well-documented report suitable for presentation or publishing.

Project Objectives
- Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data.
- Analyze time trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare metrics across selected countries or regions.
- Visualize data with informative charts and maps.
- Communicate findings using narrative insights within a Jupyter Notebook.

  Tools and Libraries Used
- Python (programming language)
- pandas (data manipulation)
- matplotlib (data visualization)
- seaborn (statistical visualization)
- plotly (optional for choropleth map)
- Jupyter Notebook (for running and documenting the project)

- How to Run/View the Project:
1. Download the dataset:
--- Source: Our World in Data â€“ owid-covid-data.csv
--- Save the file in your working directory.
2. Open the project notebook in Jupyter or VS Code (with Jupyter extension).
3. Run each code cell sequentially to:
--- Load and clean the data.
--- Perform exploratory data analysis.
--- Generate visualizations and insights.
4. Optional: Export the notebook as a PDF or present visuals in PowerPoint for sharing.

Insights & Reflections:
- Countries like the USA and India recorded the highest number of cases, with significant spikes observed in 2021.
- Death rates varied widely by country, suggesting differences in healthcare infrastructure and policy response.
- Some countries had rapid vaccination rollouts, while others lagged significantly, revealing global inequality in vaccine access.
- Data cleaning and dealing with missing values was a critical part of the process.
- Visual storytelling helped simplify complex data trends for clearer communication.
